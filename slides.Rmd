- Data Science education is a **commodity**
  - Content is **not** an issue
  - Various learning platforms

- **Domain experts** can help learners improve **data literacy**


- Need more dedicated courses:
  - **Data Products**
  - **Data Cleaning**
  - **Reproducible Science**

# Data Science Programs Are Too General

- Data science programs target **single broad audiences**
- Opportunity to **branch out** to different disciplines
- Democratization of data science education enables more **domain specific** learning materials

# Why Domain Specificity?

- You learn better when things are more relevant

- Internal factors for motivation
- Learning feedback loops
- Self-directed learners

# Computing + Statistics Curriculum Guidelines

#### Computing Education

- 2005: Knowledge-based
- 2020: Competency-based
  - Discrepancy between graduates and work ability

```
competency = knowledge + skill + disposition
           = what + how + why
```

]
.pull-right[
#### Statistics Education

1. Teach statistical thinking
2. Focus on conceptual understanding.
3. Integrate real data with a context and a purpose.
4. Foster active learning.
5. Use technology to explore concepts and analyze data.
6. Use assessments to improve and evaluate student learning.

## Planning the Learning Materials

Learning objectives:

1. **Name** the features of a tidy/clean dataset
2. **Transform** data for analysis
3. **Identify** when spreadsheets are useful
4. **Assess** when a task should not be done in a spreadsheet software
5. **Break down** data processing into smaller individual (and more manageable) steps
6. **Construct** a plot and table for exploratory data analysis
7. **Build** a data processing pipeline that can be used in multiple programs
8. **Calculate, interpret, and communicate** an appropriate statistical analysis of the data

## Create Your Own Learner Personas

If you do end up teaching a domain specific group (e.g., biomedical sciences)

1. Identify who your learners are
2. Figure out what they need and want to know
3. Plan a guided learning tract

- Use the surveys I've compiled.

https://github.com/chendaniely/dissertation-irb/tree/master/irb-20-537-data_science_workshops

### What's Next?

- Survey Validation (Factor Analysis)
- Learner pre/post workshop "confidence"
- Long-term survey for confidence + retention (summative assessment)
- Different types of formative assessment questions
